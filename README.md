## **Domain of Interest:** Gentrification

Our project is going to be on Gentrification in King County, Washington. The reason we are interested in the topic mainly stems from the fact that we have seen first-hand how rising house prices and rent have displaced people of colour around the city and we believe that gentrification is a major issue in King County and has been partial been driven by the growth of the Tech industry in King County.
